      "article": "Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh’s decision to pull out of IPL 2020 due to personal reasons has left a big hole in the Chennai Super Kings squad before the tournament begins on September 19 in UAE. At a time when CSK are yet to announce replacements for either Raina or Harbhajan, former India wicket-keeper batsman Deep Dasgupta said the left-hander might be back in the UAE to join the Yellow Army. \n Dasgupta, who has played eight Tests and five ODIs for India, feels Raina might miss the first few games of CSK because of the quarantine rules but he expects the dynamic top-order batsman to be back with the squad. The former Bengal wicket-keeper also hinted that this is perhaps the reason CSK are not too keen to name a replacement for Raina, who is their highest run-scorer in the IPL. \n I have a feeling that Suresh Raina will be back playing the IPL. He might miss out on the first few games because of the quarantine rules and all but I have a feeling that Suresh will be back,” Dasgupta told ESPNCricinfo. “I won’t be surprised if they don’t pick a replacement for Suresh.",

All eyes will be on Gayle, one of IPL’s biggest attractions, to light up this season as he looks forward to working with the team. \n With a new head coach in Anil Kumble and a new captain in KL Rahul, Gayle said he felt like going back to school, where a ‘new headmaster is in charge,’ while assuring his full backing towards Rahul, who will be leading KXIP in IPL 2020 starting September 19 in the UAE. \n Back in class, some new students here as well and it was good to be around them. Some new teachers here as well, we have new headmaster (head coach) in Anil Kumble. So, Universe Boss is back in school. Looking to rally around with new head boy, KL Rahul,” Gayle said in a video posted on the official YouTube channel of Kings XI Punjab. \n After scoring 368 runs from 11 matches in 2018, his first year with the franchise, Gayle bettered it last year. The big-hitting batsman scored 490 runs from 13 matches last season at an average of 40.83 with four half-centuries. Sixth in the list of leading IPL run-getters, KXIP will be heavily relying on Gayle to go all guns blazing while opening the innings with skipper Rahul.",

The power cut was scheduled to end around an hour into India’s tie with Armenia.\n Dr Ahamed, whose WhatsApp display picture is of Anand himself, refused to take any credit for helping out and told The Indian Express, “What Anand has done for chess in India is revolutionary. He made kids dream. I have always been a fan of his and even if I hadn’t made that phone call, this would have been done. But it was easier this way because I was the sub-collector of Pankaj Kumar Bansal (Chairman of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board) earlier and have known Srinath for a long time now because of our mutual love of chess.",

It also lowered pricing for U.S. buyers. \n Aramco cut Arab Light to Asia to a discount against the benchmark oil price used by the Saudis for the first time since June. It’s the second consecutive month of reductions for barrels to the region and the first month in six that U.S. refiners will see a cut. Aramco will trim pricing, too, for lighter barrels to northwest Europe and the Mediterranean region. \n Oil demand has plunged this year after the pandemic forced governments to lock down economies, airlines to cancel fights and workers to stay at home. Saudi Arabia, Russia and other OPEC+ producers agreed in April to slash output by almost 10 millions barrels a day, roughly 10% of global supply, to bolster prices. \n Those cuts and a demand recovery in China have since helped oil prices more than double.

Recently ‘Junglee’ star Vidhyut Jammwal also presented his viewpoint on the subject. \n In an online interview, the action hero admitted that it indeed is very difficult for one to make his place in the tinsel town, and then ensure that his presence is counted. He even questioned his fans that do they even realize how it feels to be an outsider from the industry. He reportedly compared an outsider to a beggar who keeps knocking at the window. He feels people like him are often considered invisible by the industry.He added that the only difference one needs to make now, is not to consider other people being invisible. \n Further, in the interview, he said that while some fields are watered, others are dead; and the one who comes from the latter can’t be destroyed. The actor feels he too has come from the dead fields.",
